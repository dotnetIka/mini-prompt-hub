# AI Usage Log - Mini Prompt Hub Development

This document logs the significant AI prompts used during the development of the Mini Prompt Hub application, demonstrating the "Trust, but Verify" principle.

## 1. TypeORM Entity Creation
**Prompt Used:** "Create a TypeORM entity called Prompt with fields: id (auto-incrementing primary key), title (string), template (text), createdAt (timestamp), updatedAt (timestamp)"

**Part of Project:** Database entity definition

**Verification:** The AI generated the correct entity structure with proper decorators. I verified the field types and added appropriate column types (varchar for title, text for template). The timestamps were correctly implemented with @CreateDateColumn and @UpdateDateColumn decorators.

## 2. Database Configuration Setup
**Prompt Used:** "Create a TypeORM DataSource configuration for PostgreSQL with environment variables for connection details"

**Part of Project:** Database connection setup

**Verification:** The AI provided a solid foundation for the DataSource configuration. I modified it to include proper error handling and added the initializeDatabase function. The environment variable fallbacks were correctly implemented.

## 3. API Endpoint Structure
**Prompt Used:** "Create Next.js API routes for POST /api/prompts (create), GET /api/prompts (list all), GET /api/prompts/[id] (get specific), and POST /api/prompts/execute (execute with variables)"

**Part of Project:** Backend API implementation

**Verification:** The AI generated the basic structure for all required endpoints. I enhanced the implementation with proper input validation, sanitization, and error handling. The execute endpoint logic for variable replacement and OpenAI integration was correctly structured.

## 4. Variable Extraction Function
**Prompt Used:** "Create a function to extract variable names from a template string using regex pattern matching for {variable_name} format"

**Part of Project:** Frontend variable parsing

**Verification:** The AI provided a working regex solution. I verified the pattern and tested it with various template formats. The function correctly extracts variable names from curly braces and handles edge cases.

## 5. React Component Structure
**Prompt Used:** "Create a React component for displaying individual prompts with dynamic form fields for variables and execution functionality"

**Part of Project:** Frontend UI components

**Verification:** The AI generated a good component structure, but I had to fix the React hooks usage issue by moving the component outside the map function. The state management and prop passing were correctly implemented after the fix.

## 6. OpenAI Integration
**Prompt Used:** "Integrate OpenAI API in the execute endpoint to send completed prompts and return AI responses"

**Part of Project:** AI execution functionality

**Verification:** The AI provided the correct OpenAI SDK usage with proper error handling. I verified the API key configuration and added appropriate error responses for failed API calls.

## 7. Environment Variables Setup
**Prompt Used:** "Create environment variable configuration for database connection and OpenAI API key"

**Part of Project:** Configuration management

**Verification:** The AI suggested the correct environment variables. I created the .env.example file with proper formatting and included all necessary variables for the application to function.

## Summary
The AI assistance was invaluable for generating boilerplate code and providing structural guidance. However, I had to verify and modify each piece of code to ensure proper error handling, type safety, and React best practices. The most significant modification was fixing the React hooks usage in the frontend component structure.
